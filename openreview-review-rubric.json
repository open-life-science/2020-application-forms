Applicants who mostly score 1s are not ready for the program and may not understand the work, the overall goals of Open Science and openness in general, how openness promotes community engagement, or how to be while learning in the community or through mentorship. Applicants who score 2s are enthusiastic if not wholly ready for the work, have a personal or professional goal to be more open (in general) and are ready to learn about Open Science from experts, mentors, and peers alike. Applicants who score 3s are ready, goal-oriented, interested in applying Open Science to their work, and excited to learn from experts, mentors, and peers alike. Please check 'I understand' to proceed.",
